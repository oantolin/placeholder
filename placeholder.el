;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a simple way to treat text in a buffer as a
;; template with placeholders where text needs to be filled in.  Any
;; occurrence of <++> in the buffer is a placeholder.  You can navigate
;; among the placeholder with the `placeholder-forward' and
;; `placeholder-backward' commands.  They move the point to the next
;; placeholder in the specified direction and delete the placeholder so
;; you can immediately start typing the text that should replace it.
;; However, if you call them again immediately after, they restore that
;; occurrence of the placeholder and move to the next.

;; The placeholder in only <++> by default, it can be changed by
;; customizing the `placeholder-string' variable.

;; A `placeholder-insert' command is also provided, to insert the
;; placeholder string.

(defgroup placeholder nil
  "Easy insertion and filling of placeholders."
  :group 'editing)

(defcustom placeholder-string "<++>"
  "String used by `placeholder-insert' as a placeholder.
Pick a string unlikely to appear in your buffers."
